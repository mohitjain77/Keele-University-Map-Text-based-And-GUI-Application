# Keele-University-Map-Text-based-And-GUI-Application

Part I: Developed a text-based application (without a GUI) that 1. prompts the user (with clear
instructions displayed) to select whether to enter a building/location name or part-name (e.g. “David”),
a building/location number, or a building/location classification; 2. prompts (according to the previous
response) the user to enter the relevant name/part-name, number or classification (with classification
options displayed); and 3. outputs each matching building/location name together with its number and
classification.

This Program reads the comma-separated values (CSV) file, which contains the
data from Appendix A; and our program able to operate correctly by building/location
names, numbers or classifications are changed within, added to or removed from this file.

Part II: Developed a second application (for the same task) that uses a TKinter-based graphical user
interface (GUI) for both input and output, rather than the text-based console.
